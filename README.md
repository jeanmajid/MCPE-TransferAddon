## Installation

## Usage

1. Add the behavior pack to your Minecraft world
2. Start the world and ensure the script is enabled and then go through the configuration process
3. Players will automatically be transferred to the configured server upon spawning

## Configuration

Create a new world, as configuration can only be done once and if you wanna do it again, you have to make a new world.

Join the world and you will get prompted to input ip and port. After you input everything, your world should now function as a transfer world.
